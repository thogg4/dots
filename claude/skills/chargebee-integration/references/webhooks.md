# Chargebee Webhook Events

## Overview

Chargebee sends webhook notifications for important billing events. Webhooks are asynchronous and may:
- Arrive out of order
- Be delivered multiple times
- Include a delay between the actual event and delivery

**Best practices:**
- Validate webhook requests with Basic Auth
- Implement idempotency using `event.id`
- Return 200 OK quickly (process asynchronously)
- Handle all event types gracefully

## Webhook Authentication

Validate webhook authenticity using Basic Auth credentials configured for your webhook endpoint.

```python
import os
import secrets

WEBHOOK_USERNAME = os.getenv("CHARGEBEE_WEBHOOK_USERNAME")
WEBHOOK_PASSWORD = os.getenv("CHARGEBEE_WEBHOOK_PASSWORD")

def is_valid_webhook_auth(auth):
    if not auth:
        return False
    username_ok = secrets.compare_digest(auth.username or "", WEBHOOK_USERNAME or "")
    password_ok = secrets.compare_digest(auth.password or "", WEBHOOK_PASSWORD or "")
    return username_ok and password_ok
```

Reject requests with invalid or missing credentials before parsing and processing payloads.

## Idempotency

Always check `event.id` to avoid processing duplicate webhooks:

```python
processed_events = set()  # Use a database in production.

def handle_webhook(event):
    event_id = event['id']

    if event_id in processed_events:
        return  # Already processed

    # Process event
    process_event(event)

    # Mark as processed
    processed_events.add(event_id)
```

## Retry Behavior

Chargebee retries failed webhooks (non-200 responses) with exponential backoff:
- First retry: After 5 minutes
- Subsequent retries: Increasing intervals
- Maximum retries: Continues for up to 3 days

Return 200 OK to acknowledge successful receipt.
